pyfmmlib is a Python wrapper for `fmmlib2d
<https://cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/fmm2dlib/fmm2dlib.html>`_ and `fmmlib3d
<https://cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/fmm3dlib/fmm3dlib.html>`_ implementations of the
`fast multipole method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_multipole_method>`_ for
`Laplace <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation>`_ and
`Helmholtz <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_equation>`_ potentials by
Zydrunas Gimbutas and Leslie Greengard (and including code by many more people).

This wrapper is far from comprehensive. It just catches the things I ended up
needing. Nonetheless, the FMMs and a fair bit of other useful stuff is accessible.

Installation
------------

Binary wheels and source code are available from the `Python package index <https://pypi.org/project/pyfmmlib/>`_.
Thank you to `Isuru Fernando <https://github.com/isuruf>`_ for working on `infrastructure to build those wheels
<https://github.com/isuruf/pyfmmlib-wheels>`_.

To build this from source, you need

* `numpy <http://numpy.org>`_
* `mako <http://makotemplates.org>`_ (`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ install mako or `ez_install mako`)

Run::

    python setup.py install

as usual and cross your fingers.

Documentation
-------------

Not much, unfortunately. Here's what I do to figure out how to use stuff::

    >>> import pyfmmlib
    >>> dir(pyfmmlib)
    ['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', '_add_plot', ...]

    Fish the desired function from this list (let's use 'legefder' as an
    example) and run:

    >>> print pyfmmlib.legefder.__doc__
    legefder - Function signature:
      val,der = legefder(x,pexp,[n])
    Required arguments:
      x : input float
      pexp : input rank-1 array('d') with bounds (n + 1)
    Optional arguments:
      n := (len(pexp)-1) input int
    Return objects:
      val : float
      der : float

This tells you how to call the function from Python.
You can then use grep to fish out the right Fortran source::

    $ grep -icl 'legefder' fmmlib*/*/*.f
    fmmlib3d/src/legeexps.f

Then look at the docs there, and you're in business. No idea what
function name to look for? Just use the same grep procedure to look
for keywords.

Crude, but effective. :)

Two more things:

* Some functions are wrapped with a ``_vec`` suffix. This means they
  apply to whole vectors of arguments at once. They're also parallel
  via OpenMP.

* ``pyfmmlib.fmm_part`` and ``pyfmmlib.fmm_tria`` are (dimension-independent)
  wrappers that make the calling sequence for the FMMs just a wee bit less
  obnoxious.  See ``examples/fmm.py`` for more.

  Here's a rough idea how these are called::

      from pyfmmlib import fmm_part, HelmholtzKernel

      pot, grad = fmm_part("PG", iprec=2, kernel=HelmholtzKernel(5),
              sources=sources, mop_charge=1, target=targets)

  Unlike the rest of the library (which calls directly into Fortran),
  these routines expect ``(n,3)``-shaped (that is, C-Order) arrays.
